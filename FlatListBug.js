In React Native, when working with FlatList, a common performance issue arises when rendering a large number of items.  If you're not using optimization techniques like `ItemSeparatorComponent`, `keyExtractor`, `renderItem` with efficient rendering logic, and `removeClippedSubviews`, scrolling can become incredibly slow or laggy.  Another performance issue might stem from using unnecessarily complex components within the FlatList items, or from constantly updating the data within the FlatList without implementing efficient data management (e.g., using `shouldComponentUpdate` or `useMemo` hooks).
