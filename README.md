# React Native FlatList Performance Optimization

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets and provides an optimized solution.  The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the performance problem, while `FlatListSolution.js` offers optimized code leveraging techniques like `keyExtractor`, `ItemSeparatorComponent`, `removeClippedSubviews`, and optimized rendering logic to enhance scrolling smoothness and responsiveness.

## Problem:
Slow scrolling and lagging UI when rendering a significant number of items in a FlatList.
